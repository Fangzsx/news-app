## Difficulties and Inspiration
This app was inspired by a tutorial created by Philipp Lackner on Youtube. I was curious about different ways to implement MVVM Architecture and so I followed his video. This is also my first project where I used Figma to create my design. As a bonus, I was able to have a grasp of using Pagination.

## Features
1. Local News- PH-based headlines that was generated by the NewsAPI
2. International News- Since the API has no option for International News, I used US-based headlines.
3. Save News for Future Reading - Save your favorite or to-read later.
4. Search for an Article- Use keyword to get a list of news related to your query
5. No Internet Connection/Unknown Response Error Handling- Prevent the app from crashing if no internet or an unexpected response occur.


## Project Experience
I learned a lot in this project especially the option to put all ViewModel functionalities into the parent Activity. Normally, I put my ViewModel to each fragment individually, and in my opinion, that was more organized rather than putting them into a single file, in this case, the NewsActivity itself. For the sake of organizing, I prefer it that way because if a certain fragment or activity does not do exactly what I want, I'll just check its respective ViewModel. As for saving articles, I used Room Database.
